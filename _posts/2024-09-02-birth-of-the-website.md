When students learn a new programming language, a "Hello, World!" program is usually the first thing they write. But what's slightly lesser known is that "Hello, World!" is also often used as a sort of sanity check to see if a system is working.[^1] This page serves both functions; although technically this website has been up and running before this was posted, this post marks the official start of the development of this website and serves as as check to see if this whole "blog" thing will work.

Anyways, welcome! Here, I'll probably post relevant updates to my life or projects or other random or interesting things. As for this, I'm just trying to write something to fill space and also test out the table of contents feature this template has. It looks pretty neat.

### A bit of history

Actually, this isn't my first website ever. Back in the day (middle school, 10 years ago nowðŸ˜³) I made some websites which are now probably lost to time. One was about rubik's cubes, another was supposed to be some maze where to get to a certain page you had to figure out which links to click.

At that time I wanted to make an actual website where I could put actual things on it, but then I didn't know what to put, and considering the child I was at the time it's probably better I didn't a website then.

### Getting started

Now for this website. I decided to go with GitHub pages since it's free and supports these Jekyll-based themes. This is my first time with all of this, so it's taking a second to learn, but a few hours later I'm getting the hang of it. I ended up forking the Minimal Mistakes theme so I can make custom edits to it, so I'm also trying to figure out what everything does in this repo.

Right now I have a few empty pages set up with navigation and I'm going to try to edit the theme to fix the home page a bit.

That's all for this entry!
